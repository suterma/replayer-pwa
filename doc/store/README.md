# [Replayer](https://replayer.app/) technical store documentation

## Purpose

The Replayer store consists of these parts

-   The **compilation**, in JSON , with all the currently available playback metadata (including tracks with cues). Technically, it's stored in the _Local Storage_, with the _COMPILATION_ key.
-   The **currently selected cue or track**'s GUID, which can represent any single cue or track, or none, of a compilation. Technically, it's stored in the _Local Storage_, with the _SELECTED_CUE_ID_ or _SELECTED_TRACK_ID_ key, respectively. Note: This is not equal to a playback position.
-   A set of **media files**, as BLOBs, for playback with the compilation's tracks. Technically, it's stored in the _IndexedDB_, with the key referencing a track's media URL.
-   The **settings** for the application, in a Pinia Store, as individual _Local Storage_ items.
-   The **audio environment** consisting of the Web Audio API context and the individual media elements, in a Pinia Store, as individual _Local Storage_ items.

## Store access

Most components typically do not access the store directly, following the [dumb component pattern](https://namingconvention.org/vuejs/smart-dumb-naming.html).
