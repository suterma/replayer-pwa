Replayer is a free, cue-based media player for rehearsals with playback music.
By the click of a button, Replayer starts to play at predefined times in the audio file

# How it works

1. First, create a compilation of music files (mp3, wav, flac, ogg, aiff, acc, ...) as tracks and cues
1. Each cue represents a point in time (e.g. intro, verse, chorus,...) in the playback file, with a name and an optional shortcut mnemonic
1. In the session, using Replayer on your portable computer, play any part of your set with the click of a cue button.
1. Additionally, you can use a (bluetooth) numeric keypad, as a remote control
